      <h1>On Projects</h1>
      <p>
        As my first blog post in over several months, I wanted to touch upon the
        concept of side projects and maybe even jump into what makes them so
        darn difficult.
      </p>
    </header>
    <article className="lh-copy">
      <section className={nestedCopySelector}>
        <h3 className="code mv3">Side Projects</h3>
        <p>
          Side projects are most consistently the things that every web
          developer will talk about. If you run into another web developer on
          your way to Starbucks you will most definitely talk about side
          projects at some point in your conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are the part of our lives as web developers that keep us so
          excited about the our work. Being able to explore different ideas and
          actuall make things while doing this exploring is one of the reasons I
          personally love web development so much.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though I really enjoy working on these side projects, they can
          sometimes be really difficult to deal with. Every step of the process
          I find difficult to go through with.
        </p>
        <h5 className="code underline">The Side Project Lifecycle</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>The Idea üí°</li>
          <li>The Implementation: üõ†Ô∏è</li>
          <li>The Completion ‚úÖ</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I encounter issues in all three steps listed above. The first and
          third are by and far the most difficult steps to actually accomplish.
          Coming up with a fresh and new idea to implement is the second hardest
          thing I do as a web developer (the first is vertically centering
          things in IE8-11 üòÑ). I consistently need to fall back to helpful
          repos like this one{' '}
          <a
            href="https://github.com/melanierichards/just-build-websites"

            on website ideas
          </a>
          , and if you have read many of the blog posts on my website you will
          know that articles about side projects outnumber the actual number of
          side projects about 30 to one.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second hardest thing to actually finish on that list is the
          completion stage. I always get about a quarter or half-way into a
          project and then decide to ambandon it either because I got tired of
          the idea, or because I just
          {` didn't `}
          want to work on it anymore.

        <p>
          Putting in the effort to continue to do what you do at work, but at
          home and on your time is terrible. I have been trying to stress the
          need for me personally to have a really strict cutoff between work and
          personal time and so far it has worked out alright. But now that I am
          building projects with the same technology that I build my side
          projects with it gets increasingly difficult to notice the difference
          between work and play.

          As with every other piece of content I create, I
          {` don't `}
          have a solid ending yet for this blog post. And since I would rather
          push it out in its current state then let it sit here in my editor and
          collect digital dust I will leave you the reader with this:
