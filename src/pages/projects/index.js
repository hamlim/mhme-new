            This website is one of the largest time sinks for me. I consistently
            spend time testing out other techniques, tools, and technologies on
            this. Over the past two months I have dropped all work on anything
            else (outside of my actual job of course) to revamp this website.

            Future-Grid is a complete forward facing css grid system. It is
            built to support IE8 and up, and uses flexbox, and is also the first
            and only CSS Grid grid framework. I built this in the span of a
            short weekend as a test for myself and also as a way to learn more
            about CSS Grid.

            Dollar was one of my first full on projects. And to this date I
            still consider it as one of the most ambitious projects I have
            worked on by myself. It involved a lot of crappy JS when I first
            made it but I am working on refactoring it to use react and redux. I
            think at the moment of writing this it is extremely broken, but I
            plan on getting back to it after I polish off the rest of this
            website.

          <Description>
            Bundles was I believe the first project that I worked on full time,
            I think Dollar superseeds it in a few places mainly because Dollar
            was more a fully functioning webapp. Bundles still works to this
            date, however it never really got to a place where I was comfortable
            with it. I ended up spending more and more time building out Dollar
            over Bundles.
